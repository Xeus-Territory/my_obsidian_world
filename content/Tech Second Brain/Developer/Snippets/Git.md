# Delete branch

Follow the article to understand how we can remove the branch in local and remote, use `-d` flag at: [Git Delete Remote Branch â€“ How to Remove a Remote Branch in Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-delete-remote-branch/)

For locally, just use `-d` with command `git branch`

```bash
# e.g: you want to delete release-v1 branch
git branch -D release-v1 # For delete branch
git branch -d release-v1 # For fully merged branch
```

For remote, use `-d` with command push

```bash
# e.g: you want to delete release-v1 branch, but not locally, but remotely
git push origin -d release-v1
```

# Change commit contents

You can change author for commit with flag `--author` with commit command

```bash
git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>" --no-edit
```

And you can take it with new message with flag `--message` or `-m` with commit amend

```bash
git commit --amend --message "Hello_world"
```
