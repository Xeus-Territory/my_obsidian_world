# What we need when build the android

>As my knowledge, you have multiple way to build and assemble anything of mobile, and last progress, you will have `apk` file and easily to delivery to another platform to test and use. such as
>- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
>- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) (Mostly use for automation, but it just use gradle)
>- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
>- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)

Tool is just a tool, you need to know how the way build progress work that all, but familiar with one of those can help you push the productivity, and get something. Therefore, I want to share about `Gradle`, as least I can guide you about cutting off effort when you want to build `android` with this one

But before we talk about `Gradle`, you need to know about `Android` project requirements which help to compile and show your result, I will share you about guide to install and setup, you can check your machine, It has or not, If not, you need these bro ðŸ˜„, including

- [Install Android Command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#:~:text=Command%20line%20tools%20only)
- [Install Java](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-ubuntu)
- [Install Android SDK](https://gist.github.com/EmadAdly/dfd18bf1ed7380fb9754ef798d23ec3b)
- [Command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/tools)

# Install requirements

If you check the requirements and not meet, you can follow the step to install and setup your environment

## Install java

First of all, with recommendation, you will need at least `jdk 17` installing for except the error, and problems. With Ubuntu, the easily way you can install with `apt` but not meet the problems, please use [the blog](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-ubuntu)

With `apt` , you can do the command for get the `java` on your host

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-18-jdk -y
```

```bash
$ java --version
openjdk 18.0.2-ea 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04, mixed mode, sharing)

$ which java
/usr/bin/java
```

## Install Android command-line tools

For stable and install directly, you need to access [official page of Android](https://developer.android.com/studio) and find to the last, It show you about **Command line tools only**, Choose the version for your OS (Linux, Mac or Win)

![[Pasted image 20240517141113.png]]

Some thing mess up in here, the link show for you need one more step `approve` the license and the lastly you will have link to download

![[Pasted image 20240517142053.png]]

After that you can use `curl` or `wget` to download these to your host

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest.zip && unzip *.zip
```

After extract, you will have `cmdline-tools`

```bash
$ ls cmdline-tools/bin
apkanalyzer  avdmanager  lint  profgen  resourceshrinker  retrace  screenshot2  sdkmanager
```

You need to put the tools which download to system folder, such as `usr/lib` or `usr/local` for example

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.android-sdk/

mv cmdline-tools ~/.android-sdk/
```

**UPDATE**

>[!bug]
>But anything not easily, if you perform the next step and check `sdkmanager`, you will met the problems about  `cmdline-tools : could not determine SDK root`, and it occur from `SDK 29+` ðŸ¤­, so just follow `sdk` recommendation or fix from [StackOverFlow - cmdline-tools : could not determine SDK root](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65262340/cmdline-tools-could-not-determine-sdk-root). You can perform like these

```bash
# Add latest folder to cmdline-tools
mkdir -p ~/.android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest

# Moving all kind of things inside previous cmdline-tools to latest
pushd ~/.android-sdk/cmdline-tools
sudo mv bin lib source.properties NOTICE.txt latest
ls -la latest/bin
popd
```

Lastly, you need to export `PATH` for both `ANDROID_HOME` and `bin` of `sdk` which help your machine understand and permit for your execution

```bash
# .bashrc: Shell bash or .zshrc: Shell ZSH
echo "export ANDROID_HOME=\"\$HOME/.android-sdk\"" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin\"" >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload profile
source ~/.zshrc

# Vice versa with bash
```

Check the version of `sdkmanager`

```bash
$ sdkmanager --version
12.0
```

## Install another Android SDK

![[meme-overwhems.png]]

Last step, you need to perform to download `build-tools` and `platform-tools` for your shell

But before perform downloading, you can list all package you can add with `sdkmanager` on remote repository, and `--list` flag

```bash
sdkmanager --list
```

![[Pasted image 20240517151940.png]]

You can select the version android `build` and `platform` tools that you need. After the decision you can use `sdkmanager` to add them

>[!quote]
>With me, I choose the stable version for installing, and version is [`Android 14`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14), including
>- build-tools;34.0.0
>- platforms;android-34

```bash
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34"

sdkmanager "build-tools;34.0.0"
```

![[Pasted image 20240517153323.png]]

After that, you need to perform command `license` to perform approve and commit to use, and `sdk` will active these package

```bash
sdkmanager --licenses
```

![[Pasted image 20240517153619.png]]

That all step you need, (optional) you can perform update command if you think necessary

```bash
sdkmanager --update
```

# Build with Gradle

![[thumbnail-gradle.png]]

>[!info]
>Gradle Build Tool is a fast, dependable, and adaptable open-source build automation tool with an elegant and extensible declarative build language.
>
>*From: User guide by https://docs.gradle.org/*

Gradle is a widely used and mature tool with an active community and a strong developer ecosystem.

- Gradle is the most popular build system for the JVM and is the default system for Android and Kotlin Multi-Platform projects. It has a rich community plugin ecosystem.
- Gradle can automate a wide range of software build scenarios using either its built-in functionality, third-party plugins, or custom build logic.
- Gradle provides a high-level, declarative, and expressive build language that makes it easy to read and write build logic.
- Gradle is fast, scalable, and can build projects of any size and complexity.
- Gradle produces dependable results while benefiting from optimizations such as incremental builds, build caching, and parallel execution.

Which those feature and characteristics of Gradle, It suppose the first thing which you want think to build `Android` is `Java`

Following [the installation guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html), I will show you how we can install Gradle in your host. If you want to dive depest into `gradle` with Android, you can double check at [Android Documentation - Gradle build overview](https://developer.android.com/build/gradle-build-overview)

## Install Gradle

You have two way to install Gradle, via [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) or binary manual install. You can try with SDKMAN but I choose download from binary for more understand and configuration

1. You need to access [Download link](https://gradle.org/releases?_gl=1*1fthaq8*_ga*MTgwMjUwNTQ4OC4xNzE1OTI2OTYw*_ga_7W7NC6YNPT*MTcxNTkzNTI1Mi4yLjEuMTcxNTkzNjQ4MC40Mi4wLjA.) to get the latest Gradle distribution

2. Access next to [binary-only](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=8.7&format=bin) to download compress of Gradle or use `curl` `wget` command to download from direct link

```bash
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.7-bin.zip
```

3. Next to, `unzip` the folder and Gradle folder extract

```bash
unzip gradle-8.7-bin.zip
```

![[Pasted image 20240517160633.png]]

4. Access `bin` directory in side `gradle`, you will find twice binary find one for linux and one for `DOS`

![[Pasted image 20240517160751.png]]

5. With Linux, you just need `mv` or `cp` the whole `gradle` folder to your execution location, for example `/usr/local/bin`

```bash
sudo mv gradle-8.7 /usr/local/

echo "export PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/gradle-8.7/bin\"" >> ~/.zshrc

gradle --version
```

![[Pasted image 20240517161405.png]]

But moreover, sometime I see Developer put `gradlew` binary to install and setup the environment, you can image like these

![[Pasted image 20240517161526.png]]

And `gradlew` is calling `wrapper` of `gradle`, moreover can find in [the documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) or [explaining video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aA949H-shk&ab_channel=Udacity)

#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions Â«$varÂ», Â«${var}Â», Â«${var:-default}Â», Â«${var+SET}Â»,
#           Â«${var#prefix}Â», Â«${var%suffix}Â», and Â«$( cmd )Â»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially Â«caseÂ»;
#         * various built-in commands including Â«commandÂ», Â«setÂ», and Â«ulimitÂ».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "$@", and eventually passing that to Java.
#
#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,
#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;
#       see the in-line comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project.

## How to build the android

When you build the android, you need to put the file inside the `app` folder, called `build.gradle`. These documentations can helpful for you , because I do not familiar with theses but maybe you know about that

- [Create your first Android app](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app#0)
- [Building Android Apps Sample](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_android_apps.html)
- [Tutorials Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/partr1_gradle_init.html)

On my circumstance, `DevOps` is not define these,  you know all of these will prepare and just actually run the command, on the `package.json` and related command for execution the build process. Therefore, expectation I will find the way to perform build and assemble to `apk` file

Usually use can use `gradlew wraper` with option `assembleRelease` to bundle build and compression anything else, and output for us the `.apk` file.

```bash title="build.gradle"
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "33.0.0"
        minSdkVersion = 21
        compileSdkVersion = 33
        targetSdkVersion = 33
        // We use NDK 23 which has both M1 support and is the side-by-side NDK version from AGP.
        ndkVersion = "23.1.7779620"
    }
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.1")
        classpath("com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin")
    }
}
```

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

>[!done]
>When you perform command, usually the `apk` file can compress and locate in `/app/build/intermediates/apk/debug/<name>.apk` (With `gradlew`) or `app/build/outputs/apk/release` (With `fastlane`) or maybe on the other route base on your version of `gradle` and `gradlew`. You can follow the articles for more understand: [Build your app from the command line](https://developer.android.com/build/building-cmdline)

# Conclusion

>[!info]
>That all for today, I hope this blog can help you something on setup and prepare the environment for build the android project. You can combine all these task with just one file and click, and anything will completely ready.

>[!quote]
>When you learn a new thing like android, the new cool experience with me. `Gradle` and `Gradlew` that such a cool things. Maybe I don't familiar much with `Gradle` or `Maven` but on the another session, I and you will explore more about that. So farewell @all, stay safe, hacking and learn more incredible things
