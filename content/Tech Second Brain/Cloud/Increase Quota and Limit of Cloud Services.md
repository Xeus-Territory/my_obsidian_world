>Hi @all, how is your week? Do you find new thing? I hope all of you have feel well, and happy with your life. This week is a certain sticky week, I have not much time to do anything, but little bit about my research about quotas and limits of cloud services, maybe it's pleasant. Let's digest with me

# Quotas and limits Cloud Services

>[!question]
>Almost cloud services offer for us multiple resources, and services, you can use and take experience with those one. But sometime, you will feel kind of strict because of quotas and limits, It means cloud providers try to set and block your services adopt with some boundaries, if you don't tackle with this limit, your services won't work with your expectation.

For example, in my circumstance, when I try to manage your AWS Security with Identity Center, you can read about this services via my blog [[AWS SSO from Self Gitlab Terraform Module Registry]], this one in [default configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/limits.html) will set only ten (10) managed policy and customer policy for each role, and it causes some disturbance when I try to enhance the permission for members who inherit role from center, really frustrated ðŸ˜¢

But this story has difference perspective, and I think Cloud Service right in this situation. Why? Because in my opinion, Cloud Services set quotas and limits for multiple reason, such as

1. Ease to manage and control whole services, you will not cause any spike unless you receive compatible permission from Cloud Providers
2. Create the usage alert to help you detect anomaly resources and services in your Cloud Account

You can explore more about reason why cloud services try to set boundaries for their services

- [AWS - What is Service Quotas?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html)
- [Azure - Quotas overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/quotas-overview)
- [GCP - Cloud Quotas overview](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/overview)

Obviously, The behavior of user is important, therefore cloud services permit for us increase that quotas, and it's truly meaning for who want to do stuff with well-off configuration

You can explore and follow the quotas and limits of Cloud Services with those link below

- [Azure - Subscription and Service Limits, Quotas, and Constraints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- [AWS - Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html)
- [GCP - View and manage quotas](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage)

>Therefore, I will write take a note about AWS and Azure, which two of enormous cloud services I use for job and personal currently
# Request to increase your one

As I relate above, Cloud Providers help user have a chance to increase the quotas and limits resources and services, It helps you change your demand depended on your expectation, not more or not less. With Azure and AWS, you need to create requests, and wait for giving the thumbs up from them before you can try in your resources or services.

## AWS

With AWS, you will need to approach this change through Web Portal and AWS CLI, and it's up to you. In my opinion, I prefer to use web portal for tackling issues. Explore more through article [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html)

AWS separates the quotas into two types, focus to ease manage

- **Account-level**Â â€“ Request a quota increase at the account-level for an account-level quota
- **Resource-level**Â â€“ Request a quota increase for a specific resource for a resource-level quota

First of all, you need to access [ServiceQuotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home) in your AWS Portal

![[Pasted image 20241020134911.png]]

In this console, you will have optional to view and see the quota of AWS Services. To change and request increase, you need to choose **AWS Services** and type what services you want into search box.

![[Pasted image 20241020135222.png]]

If you choose service, you will have information about services, and now you can tick an choose of **Quota name**, which you want to increase and click **Request increase at account level**

![[Pasted image 20241020135504.png]]

In the **Increase quota value** part, you can choose what number you want and click **Request** to make request, and wait for approving from AWS.

>[!info]
>For each services, you can find about how maximum quota you can set your requirement services, check at [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html). If your quota value valid for adjusting, you can try to access external link for each services to find maximum value.
>

>[!note]
>But hold up, some service you want to adjust but it's not here, because your service work for global, it means you need to switch to global location to exchange the value, surprise yah ðŸ˜ƒ.
>In usual, the region `us-east-1` is place you can handle the global value.

Some services, you need to exchange in the global, including

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Billing And Cost Management Data Exports
- AWS Billing Conductor
- AWS CloudFront
- AWS Route53
- AWS Organizations
- AWS Artifact
- AWS Health Dashboard

For example, in my situation, I want to increase quota **Managed policies per role** from ten (10) to twenty (20), I need to switch to global region, and now available to changing it into new value, strange but secret ðŸ˜„

You must wait to the status of request, change from **Pending** to **Approved**, It means your AWS Accounts have permission to use with new quota. You can check about your status request inside **Quota request history**

![[Pasted image 20241020141353.png]]

Some caution from AWS about increase small and big quota for services, check down below

![[Pasted image 20241020141505.png]]

It's still having boundaries yah, but I think that good for you confirm any huge changing ðŸ”¥

Furthermore, AWS supports to create the template request, It means when you create new AWS Account, and this request quota will automatically trigger, and that one really helpful when you try to create multiple account, and doesn't need to switch to each account, and making the request. You can use at **Quota request template**

![[Pasted image 20241020142122.png]]

There are two things you need to do for using this feature

1. Enable **Template association**, It permits for new account in organization to use the request template
2. Add the request quota about your expectation services which need to automatically increase. (NOTE: You can add up to 10 quotas)

## Azure

How about Azure? It's same one or not. The answer is same but it's have some different when adapt this change. Explore about that via [Request a quota increase in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/vi-vn/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal)

Currently, the request quota need you create service, It means if you don't have any services, you won't make request to increase quota. This one is different about Azure and AWS because It's effect into one or multiple **Subscription**, the unit manage resources and services of Azure Cloud

But wait, there are different with other service, if I choose [Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview), I can see the quota which doesn't return empty in dashboard quota

![[Pasted image 20241020143326.png]]

Now I can click on the pen symbol in **Request adjustment** column, and create a request to increase the number of storage accounts can exist in each region. To see what maximum value, you can take a look at [Azure - Subscription and Service Limits, Quotas, and Constraints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) and find services you want to increase.

Same as AWS, Azure Quota have some tricky there, and you need to spot to make increase expectation quota for your services.

>[!note]
>The selected provider is not registered for some of the selected subscriptions. To access your quotas,[register the resource provider.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)

About the caution, this one try to describe with you about there are some services Azure disable when you first create your subscription, to enable, you need access into `Subscription --> Settings --> Resource providers`

![[Pasted image 20241020144132.png]]

If you don't enable these one in your subscription, you will not able to use or deploy your services with those types in this **subscription** 

You think you are done, not yet, you need to approach to **Help + Support** service of Azure for increase quota in region level, because some quota value you can't increase with no reason. You can direct access to **Help + Support** service but this feature is quite hard to use, you can use Help Support service direct into **Quotas** Service

![[Pasted image 20241020145033.png]]

This dashboard have symbol supporter in **Request adjustment** column, and click one of you want and now it will pop up **support request** page, and now you can create your request

![[Pasted image 20241020145353.png]]

In Additional detail, you can double click into **request detail** and type new quota for your service. Next choose **No** for diagnostic if you don't want to support. Your support time will depend on your support plan, It means you pay more, you can quickly receive response from Azure Supporter.

![[Pasted image 20241020145702.png]]

It's really helpful for big project, and sometime complicate for newbie which come to first start. But it's really absorbing.

One more way you can create the support ticket, you can come to search bar and find **support request**, and in marketplace part, you can choose this one

>That @all for this weekend, It's not long story but hope so it conveys your valuable knowledge, and you can try to adapt it for your work or personal project with Cloud Services. There are huge things out there need you to find out about cloud, and quota is absorbing topics you need to spot, ain't gonna lie that tuff ðŸ™Œ
