>[Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-policy/)Â is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies to control or audit your resources. These policies enforce different rules over your resource configurations so the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.

The main advantages of Azure Policy are in the areas of enforcement and compliance, scaling, and remediation. Azure Policy is also important for teams that run an environment that requires different forms of governance.

There are four basic steps to create and work with policy definitions in Azure Policy.

>Organizations that use multiple subscriptions need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance. Azure management groups provide a level of scope and control above your subscriptions. You can use management groups as containers to manage access, policy, and compliance across your subscriptions.
