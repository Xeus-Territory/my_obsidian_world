>*“CTFs are gamified competitive cybersecurity events that are based on different challenges or aspects of information security. They are excellent for both beginners and experienced hackers looking to develop, test, and prove their skills because they gamify hacking concepts. We're big believers in the power of gamification here at Hack The Box! Gamification makes learning about something like a video game. Because gamification is fun and makes you think creatively, it’s one of the most effective ways to learn and develop skills.”*
