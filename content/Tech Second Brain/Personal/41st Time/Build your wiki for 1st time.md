I don't have much experience for use  with more `note-taking` applications but [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/) - The most popular & choice with some pros and cons like

![[Pasted image 20240311140112.png]]

>[!info]
>**Notion pros:**
>- Best-in-class collaboration and team note-taking features
>- Packs in lots of features, like task management, databases, and pretty much anything else you care to think of 
>
>**Notion cons:**
>- If you're looking for a personal note-taking app, it can be a bit over the top

But with me, It has some problems. If you have not fast and stable internet, It will be hard to control what you write, maybe It's not writable. Poor things !!! 🤭.

When you published things to Internet, simply you push the HTML to browser and your browser need to serve them and with specify things like language, `Markdown`, you can easily resolve the problems. With `Markdown` you can handle write the text with syntax and can converted into HTML, like bold, italic, align, ... Mark down will support that, with me, I trust and lovely two platform

- [HackMD - Website](https://hackmd.io/)
- [Obsidian - Locally](https://obsidian.md/)

So I will compare the difference between them but not today. Maybe, on the first time you will need a little bit time to understanding and use fluently `markdown` syntax, but trust me, when you suitable using that, you will not skip them 💯💯💯 for sure

But reason why of topic is not talking about `note-taking` applications, I want to share about the how delivery the your note to internet. On the others, I will publish about talk with `note-talking` app

# Delivery your note to Internet

*Like the page you read now, The result of published note to Internet. It will include some step, you maybe need some skill for use and deploy*

![[thumbnail-obsidian-feature.png]]
I am a big fan of `Markdown`, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which is the best choice of me when thinks about `note-taking` app. With some helpful feature like
- Free and store locally
- Published easily (Cost 10$ for months) but have way to make this
- Opensource and compatibility with huge extension
- Develop like text editor and easily usage

That reason why, I choose Obsidian to note-taking in currently for technologies, make-ideas note

## Platform to release your Obsidian note

>[!info]
>Obsidian is work with markdown syntax and you can find more tools to convert this into HTML, this technical call [static-site-generator](https://github.com/topics/static-site-generator "Topic: static-site-generator"). You can use this one to converting your MD file to HTML with easily and Obsidian is not exception, It work with more tools ever but trust and using template from [Quartz v4 - jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), gracefully to soon as knowing this platform, It's tough and helpful, bridge of everything 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌

<div align="center">
    <strong><em><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz">Welcome to Quartz 4</a></p></em></strong>

With Quartz, I think It's the best way for optimizing your price when you want publish your note, It's totally free, integrate with many plugin, make your note intuitive and easy to read

>[!info]

## Step by Step to delivery your note

### Clone and setup the workspace

You need some tools like `git` or `curl` to doing this job. Find and download in [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git

curl -L https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/archive/refs/tags/v4.0.8.tar.gz -o ~/quartz.tar.gz
```

After download, If you use `curl` , It need to extract this file but choose what ever you want, when download compress-file.

```bash
tar -xzf ~/quartz.tar.gz

cd ~/quartz-4.0.8
```

The default branch `v4` when you clone from source, here is some example

![[Pasted image 20240311151000.png|1000x50]]

>[!info]
>**Strategy of quartz will build all MD in content folders to public contents and web-server will serve this public folders, kind basic right 🤭🤭**

Therefore, you shouldn't push this public to your repository from now to future, Ignoring the conflict 😃. So please remember, add `.gitignore` to preventing thing problems. 

Download Obsidian and open `content` folder with Obsidian

![[thumbnail-obsidian-uxui.png]]

With Obsidian, I will recommend you install some plugin when you work with Obsidian by choosing `Settings` 👉  `Community plugins` 👉 `Turn on community plugins` 👉 `Browse` and find some plugins which helpful for you like
- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)** - Drawing tools in Obsidian like Draw.io but simple and flexible
- **Advanced Tables** - Add improved navigation, formatting, and manipulation to markdown tables in Obsidian
- **Templater** - Defines a templating language for your note
- **Icon Shortcodes** - Insert emoji and custom icons with shortcodes

### Structure of folder `content` and build your web

With the default load, Quartz will find index file in folder first and generate the contents. So keep mind you need to create the `index.md` on the root of `contents` folder like this

```bash
content
├── index.md
└── <subfolder>
```

Example the `content` folder will include two file, `index.md home.md`

```markdown title="index.md"
## This is the markdown index
```

```markdown title="home.md"
## This is the markdown home
```

After create that you just download package and compile your published, when compile the Quartz 4.0 requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. So make sure you have and If not, Check [[Install NVM in Zsh or Bash|this link]] for install `node` `npm` via `nvm`

```bash
# Install the package with currently node module
$ npm ci                

added 491 packages, and audited 493 packages in 4s

176 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

# Build the quartz and serve that with npx
$ npx quartz build --serve      

 Quartz v4.2.3 

Cleaned output directory `public` in 5ms
Found 2 input files from `content` in 9ms

```

Access `http://localhost:8080` and you will have the page on locally

### Release your blog to github-pages

With the release, Quartz will published via `github-actions`, you just need to understand a little bit of CI and use this with example from [GitHub Pages Hostings](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting#github-pages). Let analysis a little bit to understanding more

```yaml title="~/quartz/.github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages
 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
 
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
 
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
 
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for git info
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.14
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build Quartz
        run: npx quartz build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: public
 
  deploy:
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

Something you need to concert when using this CI
- The trigger event will occur when executing `push` event into `main` branch, except another !
- [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) and [concurrency](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency) , tell about the permission when run git to read credential or confirm single workflow run with group concurrency `pages`
- CI will include 2 jobs, builds and deploy:
	- With `build`, It will run on `Ubuntu-22.04` and setup environment, after that, It install package and build the contents of your site into `public`. Lastly, It will push all artifact built to github - This one will use on next jobs.
	- With `deploy`, It depends on the succeed of `build` and use `url` config in the project and release the public into `github-page`. Find more information about this steps in [deploy-pages - GitHub Action to publish artifacts to GitHub Pages for deployments](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages)

That all about CI with this `workflow`. By default, The CI is including on `~/quartz/.github/workflows` but `ci.yaml` is not suitable, so please save the above script into this folder with `deploy.yml`

Create a new repo project and configure settings for releasing project into github-page

1. **Create a new repo**

![[Pasted image 20240311164553.png]]

2. **Setting the `pages`**

You need to access `Settings` and go to `pages`, change source from `Deploy from a branch` to `Github Actions`

![[Pasted image 20240311164850.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240311165047.png]]

3. **Commit and push your pages**

> [!warning]
> **Remember, Enable github-action to forsure branch is push and run the workflow on `Actions` tab. Check [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow)**

All of steps is okay now. Alright, next you need set again `URL` to point the `quartz` locally into remotely, this project 😄😄😄😄. You can follow this step like me, basic git flow

```bash
# Check what you got
git status

# Add and commit a new file
git add --all
git commit -m "First release obsidian note with quartz"

# git branch change name, for ignoring the protected rule environment release
git branch -m main

# Set the origin to your project (Currently It on jackyzha0)
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (push)

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Xeus-DevOps/first-share-ever.git

# It' on of you, Have 2 way to push this, Use quartz or git push
git push -u origin main

npx quartz sync
```

![[Pasted image 20240311171025.png]]

Some workflow will be trigger, the task in currently is waiting to runners completely all jobs. And the result will be published on your github-pages, with me access `<github-page>/<repository-name>`

![[Pasted image 20240312093824.png]]
# Conclusion
