# Kubewekend
## Setup Self Kubernetes Cluster in locally ✍

Github: [kubewekend](https://github.com/Xeus-Territory/kubewekend)

>[!summary]
>Use the instant technologies for setting up Kubernetes cluster, with
>- Use `Vargrant` to configuration the VM with provider in `VirtualBox`
>- Ansible - To setup and run script and bring up `kubernetes` cluster on locally, Use `kind`
>- Exploring, understanding and provisioning require components inside the `kind` cluster
>- `cilium` and `ebpf` - The powerful kernel service of `kubewekend` cluster
>- How to build the High Availability (HA) Cluster. 
>- Use extend `CSI` for volume in `kubernetes` and define `kubernetes` storage class with `Ceph`
>- Setup new `app`, use `cilium` to route traffic into cluster via gateway
>- Setup the monitoring cluster inside the `kubernetes` with `node-exporter`, `cadvisor`, `prometheus` and `grafana`
>- Setup tracing, logging, profiling with `sidecar` or use `cilium-ebpf`
>- Use `kind` and `kubeadm` to expand, manage kubernetes nodes to create HA (High Available) Node
>- Cusmtomize default scheduled in kubernetes cluster with `kube-scheduler`
